    abstract = {<p>To determine how the vestibular sense controls balance, we used instantaneous head angular velocity to drive a galvanic vestibular stimulus so that afference would signal that head movement was faster or slower than actual. In effect, this changed vestibular afferent gain. This increased sway 4-fold when subjects (N = 8) stood without vision. However, after a 240 s conditioning period with stable balance achieved through reliable visual or somatosensory cues, sway returned to normal. An equivalent galvanic stimulus unrelated to sway (not driven by head motion) was equally destabilising but in this situation the conditioning period of stable balance did not reduce sway. Reflex muscle responses evoked by an independent, higher bandwidth vestibular stimulus were initially reduced in amplitude by the galvanic stimulus but returned to normal levels after the conditioning period, contrary to predictions that they would decrease after adaptation to increased sensory gain and increase after adaptation to decreased sensory gain. We conclude that an erroneous vestibular signal of head motion during standing has profound effects on balance control. If it is unrelated to current head motion, the CNS has no immediate mechanism of ignoring the vestibular signal to reduce its influence on destabilising balance. This result is inconsistent with sensory reweighting based on disturbances. The increase in sway with increased sensory gain is also inconsistent with a simple feedback model of vestibular reflex action. Thus, we propose that recalibration of a forward sensory model best explains the reinterpretation of an altered reafferent signal of head motion during stable balance.</p>},

@article{Brownstone2006,
abstract = {Since the early 20th century, it has been recognized that motoneurons must fire repetitive trains of action potentials to produce muscle contraction. In 1932, Sir John Eccles, together with Hebbel Hoff, found that action potential spike trains in motor axons were produced by "rhythmic centres", which were within the motoneurons themselves. Two decades later, Eccles attended a Cold Spring Harbor Symposium in NY, USA entitled "The Neuron". Two of the many notable presentations at this symposium were juxtaposed: one by Eccles from the University of Otago, Dunedin, NZL, and the other by J. Walter Woodbury and Harry Patton from the University of Washington, Seattle, USA. Both presentations included data obtained using sharp microelectrodes to study the intracellularly recorded potentials of cat motoneurons. In this review, I discuss some of the events leading up to and surrounding this jointly accomplished advance and proceed to discussion of subsequent studies over 5+ decades that have made use of intracellular recordings from motoneurons to study their repetitive firing behavior. This begins with early descriptions of primary and secondary range firing, and continues to the discovery of dendritic persistent inward currents and their relation to plateau potentials, synaptic amplification, and motoneuronal firing. Following a brief description of the possible mechanisms underlying spike frequency adaptation, I discuss the modulation of repetitive firing properties during various motor behaviors. It has become increasingly clear that the central nervous system has exquisite control of the repetitive firing of motoneurons. Eccles' work laid the foundation for the present-day study of these processes.},

abstract = {1. We studied spike frequency adaptation of motoneuron discharge in the rat hypoglossal nucleus using a brain stem slice preparation. The characteristics of adaptation in response to long (60 s) injected current steps were qualitatively similar to those observed previously in cat hindlimb motoneurons. The discharge rate typically exhibited a rapid initial decline, characterized by a linear frequency-time relation, followed by a gradual exponential decline that continued for the duration of current injection. However, a more systematic, quantitative analysis of the data revealed that there were often three distinct phases of the adaptation rather than two. 2. The three phases of adaptation (initial, early, and late) were present in at least one 60-s trial of repetitive firing in all but a small number of motoneurons. Initial adaptation was limited to the first few spikes except in a few trials (7\%) in which there was no initial adaptation. The time course of the subsequent decline in rate could be adequately described by a single-exponential function in about half of the trials (48\%). In the remaining trials this subsequent decline in frequency was better described as the sum of two exponential functions: an early phase, lasting < 2 s, and a late phase, which lasted for the duration of the discharge period. 3. The magnitude of initial adaptation was correlated with the initial firing frequency (i.e., the reciprocal of the 1st interspike interval). The magnitudes of the early and late phases of adaptation were correlated with the firing frequency reached at the end of initial adaptation. Neither the magnitudes nor the time courses of the three phases were correlated with other membrane properties such as input resistance, rheobase, or repetitive firing threshold. 4. The slope of the frequency-current (f-I) curve was steeper in the initial phase (first 2-5 spikes) than in either the early (< 2 s) or late (> 2 s) phases of adaptation as previously reported by other investigators. In the absence of early adaptation, a steady state for the f-I slope was reached by 0.7-1 s, the time typically reported in studies of repetitive discharge. However, when early adaptation was present (50\% of the trials), a steady-state value for the f-I slope was not reached until the cell had discharged for > 1 s. 5. To characterize the time course of firing rate recovery from the adaptive processes, the current was turned off for periods of < or = 10 s during the course of a 60-s trial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {1. The purpose of this study was 1) to characterize the decrease observed in mean firing rates of motor units in the first 8-15 s of isometric constant-force contractions and 2) to investigate possible mechanisms that could account for the ability to maintain force output in the presence of decreasing motor unit firing rates. 2. The decrease in mean firing rates was characterized by investigating myoelectric signals detected with a specialized quadrifilar needle electrode from the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) and the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of 19 healthy subjects during a total of 85 constant-force isometric contractions at 30, 50, or 80\% of maximal effort. The firing times of motor units were obtained from the myoelectric signals with the use of computer algorithms to decompose the signal into the constituent motor unit action potentials. Time-varying mean firing rates and recruitment thresholds were also calculated. 3. Motor units detected from the TA muscle were found to have a continual decrease in their mean firing rates in 36 of 44 trials performed during isometric ankle dorsiflexion at force values ranging from 30 to 80\% of maximal effort and a duration of 8-15 s. Likewise, motor units detected in the FDI muscle displayed a decrease in firing rate in 32 of 41 trials performed during constant-force isometric index finger abduction for contractions ranging from 30 to 80\% of maximal effort. In 14 contractions (16\% of total), firing rates were essentially constant, whereas in 3 contractions (4\%), firing rates appeared to increase. 4. Motor units with the higher recruitment thresholds and lower firing rates tended to display the greater decreases in firing rate over the constant-force interval, whereas motor units with lower recruitment thresholds and higher firing rates had lesser rates of decrease. Furthermore, increasing contraction levels tended to intensify the decrease in the motor unit firing rates. 5. Three possible mechanisms were considered as factors responsible for the maintaining of force output while motor units decreased their firing rates: motor unit recruitment, agonist/antagonist interaction, and twitch potentiation. Of these, motor unit recruitment was discarded first because none was observed during the 8-15 s duration of any of the 85 contractions. Furthermore, contractions outside the physiological range of motor unit recruitment (at 80\% of maximal effort) revealed the same decreasing trend in firing rates, ruling out recruitment as the means of sustaining force output. 6. The role of agonist or antagonist muscle interaction was investigated with the use of the muscles controlling the wrist joint. Myoelectric signals were recorded with quadrifilar needle electrodes from the wrist extensor muscles while myoelectric activity in the wrist flexor muscles was concurrently monitored with surface electrodes during constant-force isometric wrist extension at 50\% of maximal effort. Firing rates of the motor units in the wrist extensor muscles simultaneously decreased while the flexor muscles were determined to be inactive. 7. All the findings of this study regarding the behavior of the firing rates could be well explained by the reported characteristics of twitch potentiation that have been previously documented in animals and humans. 8. The results of this study, combined with the results of other investigators, provide the following scenario to explain how a constant-force isometric contraction is sustained. As the contraction progresses, the twitch force of the muscle fibers undergoes a potentiation followed by a decrease. Simultaneously, the "late adaptation" property of the motoneuron decreases the firing rate of the motor unit. Findings of this study suggest that voluntary reduction in firing rates also cannot be ruled out as a means to augment the adaptation in motoneurons. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

@article{Carpentier2001a,
abstract = {In 67 single motor units, the mechanical properties, the recruitment and derecruitment thresholds, and the discharge rates were recorded concurrently in the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) of human subjects during intermittent fatiguing contractions. The task consisted of isometric ramp-and-hold contractions performed at 50\% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of fatigue on the behaviour of motor units with a wide range of activation thresholds. For low-threshold (< 25\% MVC) motor units, the mean twitch force increased with fatigue and the recruitment threshold either did not change or increased. In contrast, the twitch force and the activation threshold decreased for the high-threshold (> 25\% MVC) units. The observation that in low-threshold motor units a quick stretch of the muscle at the end of the test reset the unit force and recruitment threshold to the prefatigue value suggests a significant role for fatigue-related changes in muscle stiffness but not twitch potentiation or motor unit synchronization. Although the central drive intensified during the fatigue test, as indicated by an increase in surface electromyogram (EMG), the discharge rate of the motor units during the hold phase of each contraction decreased progressively over the course of the task for motor units that were recruited at the beginning of the test, especially the low-threshold units. In contrast, the discharge rates of newly activated units first increased and then decreased. Such divergent behaviour of low- and high-threshold motor units could not be individually controlled by the central drive to the motoneurone pool. Rather, the different behaviours must be the consequence of variable contributions from motoneurone adaptation and afferent feedback from the muscle during the fatiguing contraction.},

@article{Mottram2005,
abstract = {Despite a similar rate of change in average electromyographic (EMG) activity, previous studies have observed different rates of change in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, perceived exertion, and fluctuations in motor output during the performance of fatiguing contractions that involved different types of loads. To obtain a more direct measure of the motor output from the spinal cord, the purpose of this study was to compare the discharge characteristics of the same motor unit in biceps brachii during the performance of two types of fatiguing contractions. In separate tests with the upper arm vertical and the elbow flexed to 1.57 rad, the seated subjects maintained either a constant upward force at the wrist (force task) or a constant elbow angle (position task) for a prescribed duration. The force and position tasks were performed in random order at a target force equal to 3.5 +/- 2.1\% (mean +/- SD) of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force above the recruitment threshold of the isolated motor unit. Each subject maintained the two tasks for an identical duration (161 +/- 96 s) at a mean target force of 22.2 +/- 13.4\% MVC (range: 3-49\% MVC). The dependent variables included the discharge characteristics of the same motor unit in biceps brachii, fluctuations in motor output (force or acceleration), mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion. Despite similar increases in the amplitude of the averaged EMG (\% MVC) for the elbow flexor muscles during both tasks (P = 0.60), the rates of increase in mean arterial pressure (P < 0.001), rating of perceived exertion (P = 0.023), and fluctuations in motor output (P = 0.003) were greater during the position task compared with the force task. Consistent with these differences, mean discharge rate declined at a greater rate during the position task (P = 0.03), and the coefficient of variation for discharge rate increased only during the position task (P = 0.02). Furthermore, more motor units were recruited during the position task compared with the force task (P = 0.01). These findings indicate that despite a comparable net muscle torque, the rate of increase in the motor output from the spinal cord was greater during the position task.},

abstract = {1. The main purpose of this study was to quantify the adaptation of spinal motoneurons to sustained and intermittent activation, using an extracellular route of stimulating current application to single test cells, in contrast to an intracellular route, as has been used previously. In addition, associations were tested between firing rate properties of the tested cells and other type (size)-related properties of these cells and their motor units. 2. Motoneurons supplying the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the deeply anaesthetized cat were stimulated for 240 s with microelectrodes which passed sustained extracellular current at 1.25 times the threshold for repetitive firing. Many cells were also tested following a rest period with intermittent 1 s current pulses (duration 600 ms) at the same relative stimulus strength. Cell discharge was assessed from the EMG of the motor unit innervated by the test neuron. The motoneurons and their motor units were assigned to four categories (i.e. types FF, FR, S and F; where F = FF + FR) based on conventional criteria. In all, twenty F (16 FF, 4 FR) and fourteen S cells were studied with sustained stimulation. Thirty of these cells (17 F, 13 S) and an additional two cells (1 F, 1 S) were studied with intermittent stimulation. 3. The mean threshold current required for sustained firing for a period of > or = 2 s was not significantly different for F and S cells. However, most of the other measured parameters of motoneuron firing differed significantly for these two cell groups. For example, at 1.25 times the threshold current for repetitive firing, the mean firing duration in response to 240 s of sustained activation was 123 +/- 88 s (+/- S.D.) for F cells vs. 233 +/- 19 s for S cells. These values were significantly longer than those from a comparable, previously reported study that employed intracellular stimulation. With intermittent stimulation, the firing durations of F and S cells were not significantly different from each other. 4. All cells exhibited a delay from the onset of current to the first spike, followed by a brief accelerating discharge that was followed by a slower drop in firing rate. Some cells (21 of 34 with sustained activation; 20 of 32 with intermittent) exhibited doublet discharges (interspike intervals < or = 10 ms) that were intermingled with the more predominant singlet discharges. Doublets were more common in the S cell type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Enoka1989,
abstract = {1. The activity of single motor units was recorded in the first dorsal interosseus muscle of human subjects while they performed an isometric ramp-and-hold maneuver. Motor-unit activity was characterized before and after fatigue by the use of a branched bipolar electrode that was positioned subcutaneously over the test muscle. Activity was characterized in terms of the forces of recruitment and derecruitment and the discharge pattern. The purpose was to determine, before and after fatigue, whether motor-unit activity was affected by the direction in which the force was exerted. 2. Regardless of the task during prefatigue trials, interimpulse intervals were 1) more variable during increases or decreases in force than when force was held constant at the target value (4-6\% above the recruitment force), and 2) more clustered around an arbitrary central value than would be expected with a normal (Gaussian) distribution. Both effects were seen during the flexion and abduction tasks. The behavior of low-threshold motor units in first dorsal interosseus is thus largely unaffected by the direction of the force exerted by the index finger. The absence of a task (i.e., a direction of force) effect suggests that the resultant force vector about the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger is not coded in terms of discrete populations of motor units, but, rather, it is based on the net muscle activity about the joint. 3. Motor-unit behavior during and after fatigue showed that the relatively homogeneous behavior seen before fatigue could be severely disrupted. The fatiguing protocol involved the continuous repetition, to the endurance limit, of a 15-s ramp-and-hold maneuver in which the abduction target force was 50\% of maximum and was held for 10-s epochs (ramps up and down were approximately 2 s each). Motor-unit threshold was assessed by the forces of recruitment and derecruitment associated with each cycle of the fatigue test. Changes in recruitment force during the protocol were either minimal or, when present, not systematic. In contrast, the derecruitment force of all units exhibited a marked and progressive increase over the course of the test. 4. After the fatigue test, when the initial threshold tasks were repeated, the behavior of most motor units changed. These changes included the derecruitment of previously active motor units, the recruitment of additional motor units, and an increased discharge variability of units that remained recruited. The variation in recruitment order seemed to be much greater than that reported previously for nonfatiguing conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Woods1987,
abstract = {1. In previous studies on the adductor pollicis and biceps brachii muscles we suggested that motoneuron firing rates are inhibited by a reflex from the muscle during fatigue, since: the firing rates decline during a sustained maximal voluntary contraction (MVC); recovery of MVC firing rates is prevented if the fatigued state of the muscle is preserved for 3 min by local occlusion of its blood supply; and full recovery occurs during this time once the blood supply to the peripheral muscle is restored. These findings were confirmed in the present study for quadriceps contractions. 2. These results do not necessarily imply an inhibitory reflex. The lower firing rates recorded from the muscle fibers during an MVC following 3 min of postfatigue ischemia may have been caused by either reduced subject effort (decreased muscle activation by the CNS) or impaired peripheral impulse transmission under these conditions. The present experiments, carried out on the quadriceps and adductor pollicis muscles, were designed to test this alternative explanation. 3. For both muscles, MVC contractions were sustained for 40 s with a blood pressure cuff inflated to 200 mmHg. This was followed by 3 min ischemic rest and a second 20-s MVC before cuff release. Three minutes after the blood supply to the muscle was restored a third 20-s MVC was made. Single shocks were delivered to the muscle throughout to record twitches from the relaxed muscle (Tr) before and after each MVC, and any twitches super-imposed on the voluntary contractions (Ts). The degree to which the muscle could be activated by voluntary effort was assessed from the ratio [1 - Ts/Tr]. For adductor pollicis, changes in the amplitude of the evoked M-waves were also measured. 4. Spike frequencies were only recorded during quadriceps experiments. These declined by 30\% during the initial 40-s MVC. No recovery was seen in the second MVC following 3 min ischemic rest, but full recovery occurred within 3 min of cuff release. 5. Failure to retain full muscle activation was frequently seen in all three MVCs. However, for many well-motivated subjects twitch occlusion showed no reduction in the degree to which either the adductor pollicis or quadriceps muscles could be activated voluntarily during the MVC executed after 3 min of ischemic rest compared with that performed 3 min after the blood supply had been restored.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to estimate the contribution of intrinsic activation of human motoneurons (e.g., by plateau potentials) during voluntary and reflexive muscle contractions. Pairs of motor units were recorded from either the tibialis anterior or soleus muscle during three different conditions: 1) during a brief muscle vibration followed by a slow relaxation of a steady isometric contraction; 2) during a triangular isometric torque contraction; and 3) during passive sinusoidal muscle stretch superimposed on a steady isometric contraction. In each case, the firing rate of a tonically firing control motor unit was used as a measure of the effective synaptic excitation (i.e., synaptic drive) to a slightly higher-threshold test motor unit that was recruited and de-recruited during a contraction trial. The firing rate of the control unit was compared at recruitment and de-recruitment of the test unit. This was done to determine whether the estimated synaptic drive needed to recruit a motor unit was less than the amount needed to sustain firing as a result of an added depolarization produced from intrinsic sources. After test unit recruitment, the firing rate of the control unit could be decreased significantly (on average by 3.6 Hz from an initial recruitment rate of 9.8 Hz) before the test unit was de-recruited during a descending synaptic drive. Similar decreases in control unit rate occurred in all three experimental conditions. This represents a possible 40\% reduction in the estimated synaptic drive needed to maintain firing of a motor unit compared with the estimated amount needed to recruit the unit initially. The firing rates of both the control and test units were modulated together in a highly parallel fashion, suggesting that the unit pairs were driven by common synaptic inputs. This tight correlation further validated the use of the control unit firing rate as a monitor of synaptic drive to the test motor unit. The estimates of intrinsically mediated depolarization of human motoneurons ( approximately 40\% during moderate contractions) are consistent with values obtained for plateau potentials obtained from intracellular recordings of motoneurons in reduced animal preparations, although various alternative mechanisms are discussed. This suggests that similar intrinsic conductances provide a substantial activation of human motoneurons during moderate physiological activity.},

abstract = {It has recently been shown that motor units in human medial gastrocnemius (MG), activated during standing, occupy relatively small territories along the muscle's longitudinal axis. Such organisation provides potential for different motor tasks to produce differing regional patterns of activity. Here, we investigate whether postural control and nerve electrical stimulation produce equal longitudinal activation patterns in MG. Myoelectric activity, at different proximal-distal locations of MG, was recorded using a linear electrode array. To ensure differences in signal amplitude between channels did not result from local, morphological factors two experimental protocols were completed: (i) quiet standing; (ii) electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve. Averaged, rectified values (ARVs) were calculated for each channel in each condition. The distribution of signals along electrode channels was described using linear regression and differences between protocols at each channel determined as the ratio between mean ARV from standing: stimulation protocols. Ratio values changed systematically across electrode channels in seven (of eight) participants, with larger values in distal channels. The distribution of ARV along MG therefore differed between experimental conditions. Compared to fibres of units activated during MG nerve stimulation, units activated during standing may have a tendency to be more highly represented in the distal muscle portion.},

abstract = {This brief review examines some of the methods used to infer central control strategies from surface electromyogram (EMG) recordings. Among the many uses of the surface EMG in studying the neural control of movement, the review critically evaluates only some of the applications. The focus is on the relations between global features of the surface EMG and the underlying physiological processes. Because direct measurements of motor unit activation are not available and many factors can influence the signal, these relations are frequently misinterpreted. These errors are compounded by the counterintuitive effects that some system parameters can have on the EMG signal. The phenomenon of crosstalk is used as an example of these problems. The review describes the limitations of techniques used to infer the level of muscle activation, the type of motor unit recruited, the upper limit of motor unit recruitment, the average discharge rate, and the degree of synchronization between motor units. Although the global surface EMG is a useful measure of muscle activation and assessment, there are limits to the information that can be extracted from this signal.},

@article{Gorassini1998,
abstract = {Motoneurons of invertebrates and vertebrates can continue to fire repetitively after being activated by a brief, excitatory synaptic input (self-sustained firing). This firing behavior is due to the activation of intrinsic, voltage-gated currents which produce sustained regenerative depolarizations (plateau potentials) of the cell. Examination of these intrinsic cellular properties has been performed in reduced animal preparations and it is unknown if such self-sustained firing occurs in motoneurons of the intact human. In this paper, we present evidence of this in the human by using a technique of dual motor unit recordings. Subjects were instructed to maintain a constant dorsiflexion effort, and the common synaptic input (e.g. descending drive) onto the tibialis anterior (TA) motoneuron pool was monitored by recording the firing frequency of a low threshold 'control' unit. Once the firing rate of the control unit was constant, vibration of the TA tendon recruited a second 'test' unit which continued to fire after the vibration (i.e. synaptic input) was removed, even though the firing rate of the control unit (and thus, the common drive) remained the same or decreased. Self-sustained firing of motoneurons such as this may reduce the need for prolonged synaptic input when constant muscle activation is required (e.g. for postural tone).},

@article{Powers2001,
abstract = {Our intent in this review was to consider the relationship between the biophysical properties of motoneurons and the mechanisms by which they transduce the synaptic inputs they receive into changes in their firing rates. Our emphasis has been on experimental results obtained over the past twenty years, which have shown that motoneurons are just as complex and interesting as other central neurons. This work has shown that motoneurons are endowed with a rich complement of active dendritic conductances, and flexible control of both somatic and dendritic channels by endogenous neuromodulators. Although this new information requires some revision of the simple view of motoneuron input-output properties that was prevalent in the early 1980's (see sections 2.3 and 2.10), the basic aspects of synaptic transduction by motoneurons can still be captured by a relatively simple input-output model (see section 2.3, equations 1-3). It remains valid to describe motoneuron recruitment as a product of the total synaptic current delivered to the soma, the effective input resistance of the motoneuron and the somatic voltage threshold for spike initiation (equations 1 and 2). However, because of the presence of active channels activated in the subthreshold range, both the delivery of synaptic current and the effective input resistance depend upon membrane potential. In addition, activation of metabotropic receptors by achetylcholine, glutamate, noradrenaline, serotonin, substance P and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH) can alter the properties of various voltage- and calcium-sensitive channels and thereby affect synaptic current delivery and input resistance. Once motoneurons are activated, their steady-state rate of repetitive discharge is linearly related to the amount of injected or synaptic current reaching the soma (equation 3). However, the slope of this relation, the minimum discharge rate and the threshold current for repetitive discharge are all subject to neuromodulatory control. There are still a number of unresolved issues concerning the control of motoneuron discharge by synaptic inputs. Under dynamic conditions, when synaptic input is rapidly changing, time- and activity-dependent changes in the state of ionic channels will alter both synaptic current delivery to the spike-generating conductances and the relation between synaptic current and discharge rate. There is at present no general quantitative expression for motoneuron input-output properties under dynamic conditions. Even under steady-state conditions, the biophysical mechanisms underlying the transfer of synaptic current from the dendrites to the soma are not well understood, due to the paucity of direct recordings from motoneuron dendrites. It seems likely that resolving these important issues will keep motoneuron afficiandoes well occupied during the next twenty years.},

abstract = {Contribution of outward currents to spike-frequency adaptation in hypoglossal motoneurons of the rat. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2246-2253, 1997. Spike-frequency adaptation has been attributed to the actions of several different membrane currents. In this study, we assess the contributions of two of these currents: the net outward current generated by the electrogenic Na+-K+ pump and the outward current that flows through Ca2+-activated K+ channels. In recordings made from hypoglossal motoneurons in slices of rat brain stem, we found that bath application of a 4-20 microM ouabain solution produced a partial block of Na+-K+ pump activity as evidenced by a marked reduction in the postdischarge hyperpolarization that follows a period of sustained discharge. However, we observed no significant change in either the initial, early, or late phases of spike-frequency adaptation in the presence of ouabain. Adaptation also has been related to increases in the duration and magnitude of the medium-duration afterhyperpolarization (mAHP) mediated by Ca2+-activated K+ channels. When we replaced the 2 mM Ca2+ in the bathing solution with Mn2+, there was a significant decrease in the amplitude of the mAHP after a spike. The decrease in mAHP amplitude resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of the initial phase of spike-frequency adaptation as has been reported previously by others. However, quite unexpectedly we also found that reducing the mAHP resulted in a dramatic increase in the magnitude of both the early and late phases of adaptation. These changes could be reversed by restoring the normal Ca2+ concentration in the bath. Our results with ouabain indicate that the Na+-K+ pump plays little, if any, role in the three phases of adaptation in rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Our results with Ca2+ channel blockade support the hypothesis that initial adaptation is, in part, controlled by conductances underlying the mAHP. However, our failure to eliminate initial adaptation completely by blocking Ca2+ channels suggests that other membrane mechanisms also contribute. Finally, the increase in both the early and late phases of adaptation in the presence of Mn2+ block of Ca2+ channels lends further support to the hypothesis that the initial and later (i.e., early and late) phases of spike-frequency adaptation are mediated by different cellular mechanisms.},

abstract = {The objective of our study was to resolve two issues pertaining to motoneuron (MN) spike frequency adaptation (SFA): 1) to develop an index of SFA that is sensitive to a wide range of adaptation patterns and would correlate well with MN excitability and 2) to determine whether SFA pattern is stimulus current dependent. Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) were anesthetized (ketamine-xylazine) before electrophysiological properties from sciatic nerve MNs located in the lumbar spinal cord were recorded. SFA was measured by 30-s square-wave current injections at 1.5, 3.0, and 5.0 nA above estimated rhythmic firing threshold. Discharges per second were significantly (P < 0.001) higher for 5-nA than for 1.5- and 3-nA currents > rhythmic firing threshold in the first 2 s. SFA was quantified by using ratios of the final to initial number of discharges with 1-, 2-, and 5-s bins. The best index of SFA was the percent decline in the number of spikes fired in the fifth 5-s bin relative to the first 5-s bin [1 - (bin 5/bin 1)]. With the use of this index, we found that SFA was significantly correlated with several measures of MN excitability, including estimated persistent inward current amplitude (r = -0.76) and rheobase current (r = 0.71), and tended to correlate with input resistance (r = -0.43) and frequency-current slope (r = -0.57). This index also showed the widest range of SFA among MNs. In conclusion, an SFA pattern can be ascertained for each MN and becomes more pronounced as MN excitability decreases. Finally, for the first time, we report evidence of a relationship between persistent inward current and SFA.},

In such discharges, a gradual decline in impulse frequency was found to occur during several tens of seconds. Most of this "late adaptation" occurred during the first 30 s of firing. Comparisons between the responses of different cells showed that the frequency-drop during late adaptation was strongly correlated to the impulse rate at the beginning of the discharge. For one and the same cell, late adaptation was more prominent at strong than at weaker intensities of stimulation (i.e.., at high than at lower initial firing rates). In cells capable of discharging continuously for several minutes, a semi-stationary discharge rate tended to be reached after about 1 min or less.},

On average, upper-limb muscles were activated 67\% more often than lower-limb muscles. When lower-limb muscles were activated, however, the mean amplitude of each burst was greater in leg muscles [18 and 17\% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)] compared with hand (8\% MVC) and arm (6\% MVC) muscles. Temporal association in activity between pairs of muscles was high for the two lower-limb muscles (r2 = 0.7) and relatively weak for the two upper-limb muscles (r2 = 0.09). Long-term muscle activity was only different between men and women for the biceps brachii muscle. We found no relation between duration of muscle activity in 10-h recordings and the reported values of type I fibers in men and women.},

abstract = {In spinal motoneurons, late spike frequency adaptation (SFA) is defined as the slowing of the firing rate over tens of seconds and can be seen during sustained or intermittent current injection. Although the function of late SFA is not known, it may result in a decrease in force production over time, or muscle fatigue. Because locomotion can persist for long periods of time without fatigue, late SFA was studied using intracellular recordings from adult cat motoneurons during fictive locomotion. Of eight lumbar motoneurons studied, all showed late adaptation during control conditions, but none demonstrated late adaptation during locomotor activity. The most consistent properties that correlated with the presence or absence of late SFA were those related to availability of fast, inactivating sodium channels, particularly action potential rate of rise. Evidence of the reversal of late SFA during locomotion was present for several minutes following locomotor trials, consistent with the suggestion that SFA is modulated through slow metabotropic pathways. The abolition of late adaptation in spinal motoneurons during fictive locomotion is an example of a state-dependent change in the "intrinsic" properties of mammalian motoneurons. This change contributes to increased excitability of motoneurons during locomotion and results in robust firing during sustained locomotion.},

abstract = {The discharge frequency of human motoneurons declines during a sustained isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of elbow flexor muscles, but the cause is unresolved. We aimed to determine whether motoneurons were inhibited during a sustained fatiguing contraction of the elbow flexor muscles and whether this inhibition was caused by the discharge of group III and IV muscle afferents. Subjects performed brief MVCs before and after a fatiguing 2 min MVC. During maximal efforts, electromyographic responses recorded from the elbow flexor muscles were evoked by stimulation of the corticospinal tracts at the cervicomedullary level [cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials (CMEPs)] and by supramaximal stimulation over the brachial plexus (Mmax). This revealed a novel decrease in the size of the muscle response to corticospinal tract stimulation during fatigue. During the sustained MVCs, the size of CMEPs decreased to 81 +/- 15 and 78 +/- 15\% of the control value for brachioradialis and biceps brachii, respectively (mean +/- SEM; n = 8). This recovered within 15 sec after the fatiguing contraction. In a second set of studies, input from group III and IV muscle afferents was prolonged after the end of the fatiguing contraction by holding the muscle ischemic with a cuff inflated above arterial pressure. Despite the maintained discharge of group III and IV afferents, the CMEPs again recovered within 15 sec of the end of the sustained contraction. These results show a diminished output of spinal motoneurons to stimulation of corticospinal tracts during a fatiguing MVC; however, the mechanisms responsible for this decline are not attributable to activity in group III and IV muscle afferents.},

We postulated that if the rest period resulted from an increase in firing threshold, a progressive recovery in the excitability of the motoneuron would be observed during the rest period. The excitability of soleus or tibialis anterior motoneurons was tested during the rest periods. The results showed that a previously tonic motoneuron that had dropped off during rotation, rarely responded to Ia or TMS inputs in the initial parts of the rest period; however, its response probability increased significantly in the second half. Based on these data, we suggest that the observed rotation is due to changes in firing thresholds of motoneurons during prolonged firing.},

abstract = {The discharge frequency of human motoneurons declines during a sustained isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of elbow flexor muscles, but the cause is unresolved. We aimed to determine whether motoneurons were inhibited during a sustained fatiguing contraction of the elbow flexor muscles and whether this inhibition was caused by the discharge of group III and IV muscle afferents. Subjects performed brief MVCs before and after a fatiguing 2 min MVC. During maximal efforts, electromyographic responses recorded from the elbow flexor muscles were evoked by stimulation of the corticospinal tracts at the cervicomedullary level [cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials (CMEPs)] and by supramaximal stimulation over the brachial plexus (Mmax). This revealed a novel decrease in the size of the muscle response to corticospinal tract stimulation during fatigue. During the sustained MVCs, the size of CMEPs decreased to 81 +/- 15 and 78 +/- 15\% of the control value for brachioradialis and biceps brachii, respectively (mean +/- SEM; n = 8). This recovered within 15 sec after the fatiguing contraction. In a second set of studies, input from group III and IV muscle afferents was prolonged after the end of the fatiguing contraction by holding the muscle ischemic with a cuff inflated above arterial pressure. Despite the maintained discharge of group III and IV afferents, the CMEPs again recovered within 15 sec of the end of the sustained contraction. These results show a diminished output of spinal motoneurons to stimulation of corticospinal tracts during a fatiguing MVC; however, the mechanisms responsible for this decline are not attributable to activity in group III and IV muscle afferents.},

abstract = {Prolonged and weak isometric contractions can result in neuromuscular fatigue. Alternation of discharge of motor units with similar thresholds (termed rotation) could be useful to minimize neuromuscular fatigue by providing periods for metabolic recovery of the contractile elements. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of motoneuron rotation during prolonged contractions of distal limb muscles. Electromyographic (EMG; needle and surface) was recorded from muscles of the forearm and distal leg. The subject made a slowly increasing isometric contraction to recruit and discharge a motor unit (1) for a prolonged period of time (> 30 min). Sometimes an additional motor unit (2) was recruited in which case the subject relaxed the contraction slightly so that only one motor unit remained tonic. Often it was this newly recruited motor unit (i.e., unit 2) that continued discharging, while motor unit 1 fell silent. Continued contraction would then lead to the resumption of tonic discharge of unit 1 and silence of unit 2. This would complete a rotation between motor units 1 and 2. During prolonged contractions, rotation was observed in approximately 80\% of the motor-unit pairs examined. There was no difference in rotation incidence by muscle type. For the unit pairs showing rotation, surface EMG values were significantly higher immediately prior to rotation than after rotation had occurred. Our findings show that rotation of motor units with similar recruitment thresholds during such contractions is common in distal muscles of the arm and leg and may help offset neuromuscular fatigue.},

abstract = {Spinal motor neurones can exhibit sustained depolarization in the absence of maintained synaptic or injected current. This phenomenon, referred to as a plateau potential, is due to the activation of monoamine-dependent persistent inward currents. Accordingly, activation of a plateau potential should result in a decrease in the excitatory synaptic drive required to activate a motor unit. This, in turn, has been suggested to cause a progressive decline in the muscle force at which motor units are recruited during repeated voluntary contractions. Such a progressive decrease in threshold force associated with preceding activation of a plateau potential is referred to as 'warm up'. Furthermore, activation of a plateau potential is thought to manifest itself as a decrease in the derecruitment force compared to recruitment force. Multiple muscles, however, can contribute to the detected force and their relative contributions may vary over time, which could confound measures of recruitment and derecruitment force. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the recruitment and derecruitment forces of single motor units in the human extensor digitorum and tibialis anterior during repetitive triangular-force contractions in which the contributions of other muscles had been minimized. In both muscles, we found that the recruitment thresholds of single motor units were unchanged during repeated contractions, and that the derecruitment force was consistently greater than the recruitment force. These results suggest either that plateau potentials were not engaged (or were rapidly extinguished) under these experimental conditions or that changes in recruitment and derecruitment force are not suitable criteria for detecting them.},

We suggest that if more data were available on these issues, the understanding of neuromuscular function would be enhanced substantially, especially with regard to plasticity in the motor neuron pool, adequacy of the neural drive to muscle, and flexibility of activation patterns across various types of contractions. Current data are limited and these limitations influence our ability to interpret adaptations in muscle function in health and disease.},

abstract = {There is sparse literature on the profile of action potential firing rate (spike-frequency) adaptation of vertebrate spinal motoneurons, with most of the work undertaken on cells of the adult cat and young rat. Here, we provide such information on adult turtle motoneurons and spinal ventral-horn interneurons. We compared adaptation in response to intracellular injection of 30-s, constant-current stimuli into high-threshold versus low-threshold motoneurons and spontaneously firing versus non-spontaneously-firing interneurons. The latter were shown to possess some adaptive properties that differed from those of motoneurons, including a delayed initial adaptation and more predominant reversal of adaptation attributable to plateau potentials. Issues were raised concerning the interpretation of changes in the action potentials' afterhyperpolarization shape parameters throughout spike-frequency adaptation. No important differences were demonstrated in the adaptation of the two motoneuron and two interneuron groups. Each of these groups, however, was modeled by its own unique combination of action potential shape parameters for the simulation of its 30-s duration of spike-frequency adaptation. Also, for a small sample of the very highest-threshold versus lowest-threshold motoneurons, the former group had significantly more adaptation than the latter. This finding was like that shown previously for cat motoneurons supplying fast- versus slow twitch motor units.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine the influence of the difference between the recruitment threshold of a motor unit and the target force of the sustained contraction on the discharge of the motor unit at recruitment. The discharge characteristics of 53 motor units in biceps brachii were recorded after being recruited during a sustained contraction. Some motor units (n = 22) discharged action potentials tonically after being recruited, whereas others (n = 31) discharged intermittent trains of action potentials. The two groups of motor units were distinguished by the difference between the recruitment threshold of the motor unit and the target force for the sustained contraction: tonic, 5.9 +/- 2.5\%; intermittent, 10.7 +/- 2.9\%. Discharge rate for the tonic units decreased progressively (13.9 +/- 2.7 to 11.7 +/- 2.6 pulses s(-1); P = 0.04) during the 99 +/- 111 s contraction. Train rate, train duration and average discharge rate for the intermittent motor units did not change across 211 +/- 153 s of intermittent discharge. The initial discharge rate at recruitment during the sustained contraction was lower for the intermittent motor units (11.0 +/- 3.3 pulses s(-1)) than the tonic motor units (13.7 +/- 3.3 pulses s(-1); P = 0.005), and the coefficient of variation for interspike interval was higher for the intermittent motor units (34.6 +/- 12.3\%) than the tonic motor units (21.2 +/- 9.4\%) at recruitment (P = 0.001) and remained elevated for discharge duration (34.6 +/- 9.2\% versus 19.1 +/- 11.7\%, P < 0.001). In an additional experiment, 12 motor units were recorded at two different target forces below recruitment threshold (5.7 +/- 1.9\% and 10.5 +/- 2.4\%). Each motor unit exhibited the two discharge patterns (tonic and intermittent) as observed for the 53 motor units. The results suggest that newly recruited motor units with recruitment thresholds closer to the target force experienced less synaptic noise at the time of recruitment that resulted in them discharging action potentials at more regular and greater rates than motor units with recruitment thresholds further from the target force.},

abstract = {To investigate whether the intensity and duration of a sustained contraction influences reflex regulation, we compared sustained fatiguing contractions at 25 \% and 50 \% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force in the human abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle. Because the activation of motoneurones during fatigue may be reflexively controlled by the metabolic status of the muscle, we also compared reflex activities during sustained and intermittent (6 s contraction, 4 s rest) contractions at 25 \% MVC for an identical duration. The short-latency Hoffmann(H) reflex and the long-latency reflex (LLR) were recorded during voluntary contractions, before, during and after the fatigue tests, with each response normalised to the compound muscle action potential (M-wave). The results showed that fatigue during sustained contractions was inversely related to the intensity, and hence the duration, of the effort. The MVC force and associated surface electromyogram (EMG) declined by 26.2 \% and 35.2 \%, respectively, after the sustained contraction at 50 \% MVC, and by 34.2 \% and 44.2 \% after the sustained contraction at 25 \% MVC. Although the average EMG increased progressively with time during the two sustained fatiguing contractions, the amplitudes of the H and LLR reflexes decreased significantly. Combined with previous data (Duchateau \& Hainaut, 1993), the results show that the effect on the H reflex is independent of the intensity of the sustained contraction, whereas the decline in the LLR is closely related to the duration of the contraction. Because there were no changes in the intermittent test at 25 \% MVC, the results indicate that the net excitatory spinal and supraspinal reflex-mediated input to the motoneurone pool is reduced. This decline in excitation to the motoneurones, however, can be temporarily compensated by an enhancement of the central drive.},

For this purpose wild-type and mutant channels were transiently expressed in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line and currents were measured in the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. 2. Kv4.2 channels inactivated from pre-open closed state(s) with a mean time constant of 959 ms at -50 mV. This closed-state inactivation was not affected by a deletion of the Kv4.2 N-terminus (Delta2-40). 3. Kv4.2 currents at +40 mV inactivated with triple-exponential kinetics. A fast component (tau = 11 ms) accounted for 73 \%, an intermediate component (tau = 50 ms) for 23 \% and a slow component (tau = 668 ms) for 4 \% of the total decay. 4. Both the fast and the intermediate components of inactivation were slowed by a deletion of the Kv4.2 N-terminus (tau = 35 and 111 ms) and accounted for 33 and 56 \%, respectively, of the total decay. The slow component was moderately accelerated by the truncation (tau = 346 ms) and accounted for 11 \% of the total Kv4.2 current inactivation. 5. Recovery from open-state inactivation and recovery from closed-state inactivation occurred with similar kinetics in a strongly voltage-dependent manner. Neither recovery reaction was affected by the N-terminal truncation. 6. Kv4.2 Delta2-40 channels displayed slowed deactivation kinetics, suggesting that the N-terminal truncation leads to a stabilization of the open state. 7. Simulations with an allosteric model of inactivation, supported by the experimental data, suggested that, in response to membrane depolarization, Kv4.2 channels accumulate in the closed-inactivated state(s), from which they directly recover, bypassing the open state.},

abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to examine whether facilitation of human motor unit recruitment by repeated voluntary contractions is mediated, in part, by time and activity-dependent increases in the intrinsic excitability of the parent motoneuron. To do this, pairs of tibialis anterior or soleus motor units were recorded during slowly increasing and then decreasing voluntary contractions. The firing rate of the lower-threshold motor unit of the pair (control unit) was used as a measure of effective synaptic excitation (i.e., drive) to the motoneurons. This rate was used to estimate the recruitment threshold of the higher-threshold unit of the pair (test unit). The test unit was repeatedly recruited and de-recruited in a series of contractions, and the interval between the de-recruitment and re-recruitment of the test unit (interactivation interval) was systematically varied between 0.6 and 60 s. An increase in intrinsic excitability of a unit was considered to have occurred if the level of estimated synaptic input (as measured by the firing rate of the control motor unit) needed to recruit a unit was reduced. At short interactivation intervals (1-2 s), the control unit firing frequency was significantly lower when the test unit was recruited on the second contraction, compared with the first (by 3.9 Hz or a 64\% reduction). This suggested that the intrinsic excitability of the test motor unit had increased during the second contraction because it could be recruited at a much lower level of estimated synaptic drive. Longer interaction intervals (2-6 s) produced less recruitment facilitation. At even longer interactivation intervals (>6 s) there was no significant facilitation (time constant of effect was 4.8 s). In some motor units, the effect of this short-term facilitation appeared to be so pronounced that it resulted in reversing the order of de-recruitment with the other initially lower-threshold motor units. Such reversals were occasionally observed for orderly re-recruitment. The time course and behavior of the observed short-term facilitation of motor unit discharge was qualitatively similar to the warm-up phenomenon of plateau potentials seen in motoneurons of reduced preparations (e.g., 4-6 s). The possibility of warm-up contributing to the time and activity-dependent facilitation of human motor unit recruitment is discussed.},

Numerous reports have indicated a linear relationship between isometric force and rectified, integrated EMG. These reports, the nature of their experiments, and the disagreements among them are reviewed. Particular attention is given to the effects of the signal processing in the final results, including type and location of electrodes, amplification, signal isolation, etc. The effect of joint position and level of muscular effort in the isometric case are discussed. Various proposed mathematical models of the force-EMG relationship are presented and analyzed. The concluding section of the paper summarizes the current areas of agreement and disagreement and comments on the feasibility of obtaining force-EMG relation in the presence of movement.},

@article{Gorassini2002,
abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to examine whether facilitation of human motor unit recruitment by repeated voluntary contractions is mediated, in part, by time and activity-dependent increases in the intrinsic excitability of the parent motoneuron. To do this, pairs of tibialis anterior or soleus motor units were recorded during slowly increasing and then decreasing voluntary contractions. The firing rate of the lower-threshold motor unit of the pair (control unit) was used as a measure of effective synaptic excitation (i.e., drive) to the motoneurons. This rate was used to estimate the recruitment threshold of the higher-threshold unit of the pair (test unit). The test unit was repeatedly recruited and de-recruited in a series of contractions, and the interval between the de-recruitment and re-recruitment of the test unit (interactivation interval) was systematically varied between 0.6 and 60 s. An increase in intrinsic excitability of a unit was considered to have occurred if the level of estimated synaptic input (as measured by the firing rate of the control motor unit) needed to recruit a unit was reduced. At short interactivation intervals (1-2 s), the control unit firing frequency was significantly lower when the test unit was recruited on the second contraction, compared with the first (by 3.9 Hz or a 64\% reduction). This suggested that the intrinsic excitability of the test motor unit had increased during the second contraction because it could be recruited at a much lower level of estimated synaptic drive. Longer interaction intervals (2-6 s) produced less recruitment facilitation. At even longer interactivation intervals (>6 s) there was no significant facilitation (time constant of effect was 4.8 s). In some motor units, the effect of this short-term facilitation appeared to be so pronounced that it resulted in reversing the order of de-recruitment with the other initially lower-threshold motor units. Such reversals were occasionally observed for orderly re-recruitment. The time course and behavior of the observed short-term facilitation of motor unit discharge was qualitatively similar to the warm-up phenomenon of plateau potentials seen in motoneurons of reduced preparations (e.g., 4-6 s). The possibility of warm-up contributing to the time and activity-dependent facilitation of human motor unit recruitment is discussed.},

abstract = {We investigated the firing rate of motor units in the vastus lateralis muscle in five healthy young men (mean = 21.4 yr, SD = 0.9) during a sequence of isometric constant-torque contractions repeated to exhaustion. The contractions were sustained at 20\% of the maximal voluntary level, measured at the beginning of the test sequence. Electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded via quadrifilar fine-wire electrodes and subsequently decomposed into their constituent motor unit action potentials to obtain the motor unit firing times. In addition, we measured the whole muscle mechanical properties during the fatigue task using electrical stimulation. The firing rate of motor units first decreased within the first 10-20\% of the endurance time of the contractions and then increased. The firing rate increase was accompanied by recruitment of additional motor units as the force output remained constant. The elicited twitch and tetanic torque responses first increased and then decreased. The two processes modulated in a complementary fashion at the same time. Our data suggest that, when the vastus lateralis muscle is activated to maintain a constant torque output, its motoneuron pool receives a net excitatory drive that first decreases to compensate for the short-lived potentiation of the muscle force twitch and then increases to compensate for the diminution of the force twitch. The underlying inverse relationship between the firing rate and the recruitment threshold that has been reported for nonfatigued contractions is maintained. We, therefore, conclude that the central nervous system control of vastus lateralis motor units remains invariant during fatigue in submaximal isometric isotonic contractions.},

abstract = {Central and peripheral factors were studied in fatigue of submaximal intermittent isometric contractions of the human quadriceps and soleus muscles. Subjects made repeated 6 s, 50\% maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) followed by 4 s rest until the limit of endurance (Tlim). Periodically, a fatigue test was performed. This included a brief MVC, either a single shock or 8 pulses at 50 Hz during a rest period and a shock superimposed on a target force voluntary contraction. At Tlim, the MVC force had declined by 50\%, usually in parallel with the force from stimulation at 50 Hz. The twitches superimposed on the target forces declined more rapidly, disappearing entirely at Tlim. In similar experiments on adductor pollicis, no reduction of the evoked M wave was seen. The results suggest that, during fatigue of quadriceps and adductor pollicis induced by this protocol, no central fatigue was apparent, but some was seen in soleus. Thus the reduced force-generating capacity could result mainly or entirely from failure of the muscle contractile apparatus.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine the influence of the difference between the recruitment threshold of a motor unit and the target force of the sustained contraction on the discharge of the motor unit at recruitment. The discharge characteristics of 53 motor units in biceps brachii were recorded after being recruited during a sustained contraction. Some motor units (n = 22) discharged action potentials tonically after being recruited, whereas others (n = 31) discharged intermittent trains of action potentials. The two groups of motor units were distinguished by the difference between the recruitment threshold of the motor unit and the target force for the sustained contraction: tonic, 5.9 +/- 2.5\%; intermittent, 10.7 +/- 2.9\%. Discharge rate for the tonic units decreased progressively (13.9 +/- 2.7 to 11.7 +/- 2.6 pulses s(-1); P = 0.04) during the 99 +/- 111 s contraction. Train rate, train duration and average discharge rate for the intermittent motor units did not change across 211 +/- 153 s of intermittent discharge. The initial discharge rate at recruitment during the sustained contraction was lower for the intermittent motor units (11.0 +/- 3.3 pulses s(-1)) than the tonic motor units (13.7 +/- 3.3 pulses s(-1); P = 0.005), and the coefficient of variation for interspike interval was higher for the intermittent motor units (34.6 +/- 12.3\%) than the tonic motor units (21.2 +/- 9.4\%) at recruitment (P = 0.001) and remained elevated for discharge duration (34.6 +/- 9.2\% versus 19.1 +/- 11.7\%, P < 0.001). In an additional experiment, 12 motor units were recorded at two different target forces below recruitment threshold (5.7 +/- 1.9\% and 10.5 +/- 2.4\%). Each motor unit exhibited the two discharge patterns (tonic and intermittent) as observed for the 53 motor units. The results suggest that newly recruited motor units with recruitment thresholds closer to the target force experienced less synaptic noise at the time of recruitment that resulted in them discharging action potentials at more regular and greater rates than motor units with recruitment thresholds further from the target force.},

@article{Bawa2009,
abstract = {The phenomena of substitution and rotation among motor units of a muscle were examined in seven different muscles. Intramuscular motor unit activity and surface electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded from one of the following muscles: abductor digiti minimi, first dorsal interosseous, extensor digitorum communis, flexor and extensor carpi radialis, tibialis anterior, and soleus. The subject was asked to discharge a discernible unit at a comfortable constant or rhythmically (pseudosinusoidally) modulated rate with audio and visual feedback. Results are reported from a total of 42 sets of motor units from all seven muscles. We observed that when a subject fired a motor unit for a long period, an additional motor unit frequently started to discharge after a few minutes. When the subject was asked to keep activity down to one unit, very often it was Unit 1 that dropped and Unit 2 continued to fire. Whereas Unit 2 had fired for a few minutes, Unit 1 resumed firing without any conscious effort by the subject. If the subject was then asked to retain just one unit, it was Unit 2 that dropped. Rhythmic modulation of firing rate of a tonically firing unit showed that whereas the threshold of this unit increased, the threshold of a phasically discharging unit decreased substantially. The increase in threshold of a tonically discharging unit is suggested to arise from inactivation of Na(+) and Ca(2+) channels and the decrease in threshold of higher-threshold units is suggested to arise from an increase in persistent inward currents that may occur during prolonged contractions. Whether a unit stops or starts to fire is suggested to depend on a balance between the strength of the central motor command, persistent inward currents, and inactivation of voltage-gated channels. Such rotations among low-threshold motoneurons would ensure low-level sustained contractions to be viable not only in small hand muscles but also in larger limb muscles.},

abstract = {Motor-unit firing patterns were studied in the vastus lateralis muscle of five healthy young men [21.4 +/- 0.9 (SD) yr] during a series of isometric knee extensions performed to exhaustion. Each contraction was held at a constant torque level, set to 20\% of the maximal voluntary contraction at the beginning of the experiment. Electromyographic signals, recorded via a quadrifilar fine wire electrode, were processed with the precision decomposition technique to identify the firing times of individual motor units. In repeat experiments, whole-muscle mechanical properties were measured during the fatigue protocol using electrical stimulation. The main findings were a monotonic decrease in the recruitment threshold of all motor units and the progressive recruitment of new units, all without a change of the recruitment order. Motor units from the same subject showed a similar time course of threshold decline, but this decline varied among subjects (mean threshold decrease ranged from 23 to 73\%). The mean threshold decline was linearly correlated (R2 >or= 0.96) with a decline in the elicited peak tetanic torque. In summary, the maintenance of recruitment order during fatigue strongly supports the notion that the observed common recruitment adaptations were a direct consequence of an increased excitatory drive to the motor unit pool. It is suggested that the increased central drive was necessary to compensate for the loss in force output from motor units whose muscle fibers were actively contracting. We therefore conclude that the control scheme of motor-unit recruitment remains invariant during fatigue at least in relatively large muscles performing submaximal isometric contractions.},

abstract = {Tungsten micro-electrodes have been used to record the electrical activity of single motor units in the human adductor pollicis during maximal voluntary contractions. The potentials were characteristic of those from single muscle fibres. In brief maximal contractions, the firing rates of over 200 motor units were obtained from five normal subjects. Four subjects had a similar range (mean 26.4 +/- 6.5 Hz) while the fifth was slightly higher (35 +/- 7.4 Hz). When maximal voluntary force was sustained for 40-120 s, there was a progressive decline in the range and mean rate of motor-unit discharge. In the first 60 s, mean rates fell from about 27 Hz to 15 Hz. There was some evidence to suggest that those units with the highest initial frequencies changed rate most rapidly. It is suggested that this decline in motor unit discharge rates is not responsible for force loss, but that it may enable effective modulation of voluntary strength by rate coding to continue during fatigue.},

@article{Zeng2005,
abstract = {In response to constant current inputs, the firing rates of motoneurons typically show a continuous decline over time. The biophysical mechanisms underlying this process, called spike-frequency adaptation, are not well understood. Spike-frequency adaptation normally exhibits a rapid initial phase, followed by a slow, later phase that continues throughout the duration of firing. One possible mechanism mediating the later phase might be a reduction in the persistent sodium current (I(NaP)) that has been shown to diminish the capacity of cortical pyramidal neurons and spinal motoneurons to sustain repetitive firing. In this study, we used the anticonvulsant phenytoin to reduce the I(NaP) of juvenile rat hypoglossal motoneurons recorded in brain stem slices, and we examined the consequences of a reduction in I(NaP) on the magnitude and time course of spike-frequency adaptation. Adding phenytoin to the bathing solution (> or =50 microM) generally produced a marked reduction in the persistent inward currents (PICs) recorded at the soma in response to slow, voltage-clamp triangular ramp commands (-70 to 0 mV and back). However, the same concentrations of phenytoin appeared to have no significant effect on spike-frequency adaptation even though the phenytoin often augmented the reduction in action potential amplitude that occurs during repetitive firing. The surprising finding that the reduction of a source of sustained inward current had no appreciable effect on the pattern of spike generation suggests that several types of membrane channels must act cooperatively to insure that these motoneurons can generate the sustained repetitive firing required for long-lasting motor behaviors.},

The discharge of motor units in first dorsal interosseus of subjects (27.8 Â± 8.1 years old) was recorded for as long as possible. The task was terminated when the isolated motor unit stopped discharging action potentials, despite the ability of the individual to sustain the abduction force. Twenty-three single motor units were recorded. Task duration was 21.4 Â± 17.8 min. When analysed across discharge duration, mean discharge rate (10.6 Â± 1.8 pulses s(-1)) and mean abduction force (5.5 Â± 2.8\% maximum) did not change significantly (discharge rate, P = 0.119; and abduction force, P = 0.235). In contrast, the coefficient of variation for interspike interval during the initial 30 s of the task was 22.2 Â± 6.0\% and increased to 31.9 Â± 7.0\% during the final 30 s (P < 0.001). All motor units were recruited again after 60 s of rest. Although subjects were able to sustain a relatively constant discharge rate, the cessation of discharge was preceded by a gradual increase in discharge variability. The findings also showed that the maximal duration of human motor unit discharge exceeds that previously reported for the discharge elicited in motor neurons by intracellular current injection in vitro.},
