DATA FILES
----------
Data for each subject are stored in the zipped `data` folder in these formats:
Spike2 .smr 
Matlab .mat 
Text .txt

[data->data.csv]
Audit results from the four rater concatenated into one comma-seperated values file.

[data->number_papers_published_per_year.txt]
Results of PubMed search for number of published papers by year and journal.
   

MISCELLANEOUS FILES
------------------
[misc->descriptions.txt]
[misc->descriptions_short.txt]
Full and shortened desriptions of each audit question; used when outputing results and generating figures.


CODE FILES
----------
Python and R code files to perform final data analysis and generate figures were written by Joanna Diong and Martin HÃ©roux (Python v3.6, R v3.4). Code has been tested and should be forward compatible.

Additional Python packages:
neo 0.5.2
quantities 0.12.1
numpy 1.14.0
matplotlib 2.1.2
scipy 1.0.0
pandas 0.22.
seaborn 0.8.1
statsmodels 0.8.0

Note: `script.py` also calls functions from a custom written Python package `biosig`, available here:
https://github.com/joannadiong/biosig

[script.py]
Main script. Import data, call functions from `process.py` and associated files. Plot figures for individual subjects, conduct group analysis, plot figures for the group.

[process.py, trials_key, emg_key]
Module containing functions used to clean data and plot figures. Calls functions from `trials_key.py` and `emg_key.py`.

[mmax.py]
Module to calculate activation proportions and submaximal torques during data collection.

[script.R]
Import `angle90.csv` and `angle0.csv`, calculate group means and 95% CI of the effect of % predicted maximal torque on angle, export data to `./data/proc/results_con_r.txt`. 
`script.py` plots mean slopes and 95% CI limits for the group using these data. 


INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN ANALYSIS
----------------------------
Download all code files and data.zip into a single folder. 
Unzip the data file into the same location.
Download the biosig package. 
In `script.py` (line <#>), change the user-specific file path to set the location of biosig.
Run `script.py`.

Note: for ease and transparency, all raw and processed data are hosted in the OSF repository.
