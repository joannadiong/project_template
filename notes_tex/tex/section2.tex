\section{Preliminary data: September 2015}
\subsection{Results} 
Here are my results: there was an effect and it was significant.

\subsection{Interpretation} 
The p-value was small, so it must mean something important!\lipsum[1]

\section{More preliminary data: October 2015}
More data has come in, all my previous ideas were wrong. But that is no reason not to get them published. Pollution is the way to research and academic success!

\subsection{Raw data}
Raw data is for suckers; I trust what Excel and SPSS spit out.
This is the greatest thing ever. You never have to worry if you made a cut and paste mistake; you know there will be some, and you simply learn to live with it!
